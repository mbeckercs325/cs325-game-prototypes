<h2>THIS IS A COOKING GAME</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
THIS IS A COOKING GAME is a cooperative cooking game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None, I wanted to make my own game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have to cooperate in order to complete as many recipes as they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal of the game is to work together to create as many burgers as possible. A burger consists of cooked meat, chopped lettuce and tomato, a bun, and a plate. Players have to assemble all of these before they can deliver the order.
<br>Player 1 Controls - WASD, E to select
<br>Player 2 Controls - Arrow Keys, ? to select
<br>To make a burger players must cooperate to place a plate, bun, chopped lettuce and tomato, and cooked meat all on the same spot. If all of these ingredients are on the same spot, then a burger will appear there. To pass ingredients from player to player, ingredients can be placed on the conveyor belt that goes around the kitchen.
<br>The stoves are located on player 1's side and the cutting boards are on player 2's side. To chop lettuce or tomatoes or to cook meat a player must place on of the ingredients on the correct spot. A border will appear on the ingredient over 3 seconds. After 3 seconds the ingredient is done. It can then be added to a burger.
<br>To score points player 2 must take the completed burger and place it in the delivery zone on the right side of the screen. Each burger is worth 1 point.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is evaluating a cooperative multiplayer experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>

</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Two cooks have to cooperate to create as many burgers as they can.
</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A round lasts 5 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to talk and figure out what ingredients to prioritize and when to try to pass ingredients around.
</li>
