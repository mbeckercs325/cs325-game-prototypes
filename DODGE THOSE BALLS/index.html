<h2>DODGE THOSE BALLS</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
DODGE THOSE BALLS is a quick paced game where you have to try to control two points at once.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have to master using both WASD and the arrow keys to control both sides of their line. This is tricky at first, but can be rewarding when it is figured out.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players have a line that connects two squares that they are controlling. The black one is controlled with WASD, the red on is controlled with the arrow keys. Players need to avoid getting hit by the black balls, and try to hit the green balls.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Having two sides of a line to control is tricky and I wanted to see if I could make it fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Having a variable size line in between two control points is something that I haven't seen before and wanted to try out.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to get used to controlling both sides of the line at once. This can be tricky and mastering that will allow players to get good scores.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made everything from scratch.
