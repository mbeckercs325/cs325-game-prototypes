<h2>SLINGSHOT RACING</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fast paced, top down racing time trial game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Neither, I wanted to branch out from the given themes.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used mouse input, deterministic gameplay, a competitive play style, and the racing genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
SLINGSHOT RACING is very easy to pick up and play, but it takes some time to master. I want players to get competitive and try to get the best possible times. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
SLINGSHOT RACING is a unique racing game because the player does not have complete control over their car the whole time. They shoot the car using the mouse and dragging and then the car moves in that direction until the player clicks and drags again. This is more exciting and fast paced than if the car had just been controlled with the arrow keys. The player has to react faster and differently than if they were using the keyboard.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to evaluate a different kind of racing game. I didn't want to make just a top down racing game, I wanted to add in a twist.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The slingshot feature is quite unique, and a different spin on racing games. Instead of direct control over the car with the arrow keys, the player uses the mouse to shoot their car around the track.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is about its gameplay. At its core it is just a track and a car. The player is just trying to set the best possible time that they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game is purely about its gameplay, there is no story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This is a simple game that anyone can play.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game takes less than 30 seconds to play a round, but it can be replayed many times to try to improve your time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will need quick reactions in order to get the gold medal. They will have to find the balance between speed and control. Too much speed and they might end up going off the track too much, and too much control and they won't be able to get the time they need for the gold medal.'
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the racetrack, car, and powermeter. The background and medals I borrowed from online.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I looked at several examples to make this game. I used the <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/launcher">Phaser Launcher Example</a> for the car launching interactions. I used an online <a href="https://www.joshmorony.com/how-to-create-an-accurate-timer-for-phaser-games/">Timer Example</a> to help with the timer.
