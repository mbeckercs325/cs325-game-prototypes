<h2>SLINGSHOT RACING</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A fast paced, top down racing time trial game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Neither, I wanted to branch out from the given themes.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used mouse input, deterministic gameplay, a competitive play style, and the racing genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game is purely about its gameplay, there is no story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This is a simple game that anyone can play.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game takes less than 30 seconds to play a round, but it can be replayed many times to try to improve your time.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the racetrack, car, and powermeter. The background and medals I borrowed from online.

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Medal Images: <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/medals-2">Medals</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
