<h2>ASTEROIDvCOWBOYS</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
ASTEROIDvCOWBOYS is a randomly generated bullet hell game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Both cowboys and asteroid were used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used the arrow keys as controls. The whole game relies on randomness, no two games will be the same.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
ASTEROIDvCOWBOYS is meant to be hectic and challenging. Players will have to have quick reaction times in order to survive the cowboy attacks.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In ASTEROIDvCOWBOYS the player controls a lone asteroid in a sea of cowboys. The goal is to survive and destroy the enemy planets. The asteroid is moved using the arrow keys. To destroy cowboys and planets the asteroid has to just collide with them.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating random spawns in an infinite game board.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
ASTEROIDvCOWBOYS features an infinite game world with random spawns that guarantees that every game will be different.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
ASTEROIDvCOWBOYS takes place in space. The player controls a lone asteroid that is tasked with destroying planets. However, there is an army of cowboys between the asteroid and the planets. The asteroid has to be quick and agile if it wants to complete its task.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is not much of a story besides the asteroid being tasked with destroying planets.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone can play this game. It is very easy to learn, and it can be played quickly anywhere.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game should only take a couple of minutes to complete.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to have quick reactions in order to complete the game. Since the game relies on randomness, it is difficult to plan ahead, so reactions are very important.
</li>

All of the images in the game were borrowed from opengameart.org
