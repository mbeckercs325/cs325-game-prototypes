<h2>THIS IS A COOKING GAME</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
THIS IS A COOKING GAME is a cooperative cooking game.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
None, I wanted to make my own game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have to cooperate in order to complete as many recipes as they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The goal of the game is to work together to create as many burgers as possible. A burger consists of cooked meat, chopped lettuce and tomato, a bun, and a plate. Players have to assemble all of these before they can deliver the order.
<br>Player 1 Controls - WASD, E to select
<br>Player 2 Controls - Arrow Keys, ? to select
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
What are the unique aspects of your game that set it apart?
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, put it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
