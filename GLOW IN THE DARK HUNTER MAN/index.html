<h2>GLOW IN THE DARK HUNTER MAN</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
GLOW IN THE DARK HUNTER MAN is a game where you try to hunt down all the enemies with very limited sight.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the glow in the dark theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have a relatively tense game where they don't know where exactly enemies will be coming from. There is also limited ammo which puts more pressure on the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This game is very simple to play, it uses WASD for movement and the mouse for aiming and shooting. The objective is to kill all the enemies before you run out of health or ammo.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I wanted to implement a limited field of view. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Having just the circle around you visible makes the game feel more tense.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You're a hunter that glows in the dark that is tasked with killing enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You're a hunter that glows in the dark that is tasked with killing enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone can play this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game takes a few minutes to play.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to keep track of where they see enemies and which direction they are travelling in.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used code from this <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/6771-masking-to-simulate-light-area/">post</a> to figure out the lighting.
